Use github classroom. Create a repo for you to use. Create an ipython notebook in the repo and commit it. I want you to keep committing it as you edit it so I can see it build up. Your mission is to scrape the cuny Fall 2021 academic calendar site using the requests library, beautiful soup and pandas. You should wind up with a pandas data frame where the index column is a python date. There should be a column for “day of the week” with variable label dow and a column called text with the explanation.
